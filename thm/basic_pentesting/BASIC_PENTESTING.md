## Enumeration

1. Network Enumeration

* We see that ports `80` & `22` are open, which means that there is a website that is running, which can be further enumerated. As well as SSH which can be used to connect to the machine later on.

* Other than these regular ports, we also see ports `445` & `139` which are SMB ports. These can be enumerated later on.

2. Directory Bruteforcing
```bash
/development
/index.html
```
* These are the two directories that are available on the website. There is no `robots.txt` that can be seen on the website.

* In the `/development` section we can see two files:
`dev.txt` > It talks about how SMB has been configured. I can also notice that there are two users with initials 'J' & 'K' who are talking to each other through notes.

`j.txt` > Is a message for 'J' addressing a weak password issue. 'K' tells 'J' how their `/etc/shadow` entry can easily be cracked.

3. SMB Enumeration

* For this, we use a tool called `enum4linux` which will allow us to enumerate the SMB service on this machine.
```bash
[+] Enumerating users using SID S-1-22-1 and logon username '', password ''

S-1-22-1-1000 Unix User\kay (Local User)
S-1-22-1-1001 Unix User\jan (Local User)
```
* We get the following users as a result of the SMB enumeration.

## Exploitation

* With all of this, inference can be drawn that the user 'Jan' has a weak password & if a rev-shell can be obtained, we can privesc.

* We can first use `hydra` to bruteforce port `22` with the `rockyou.txt` word list:
```bash
hydra -l 'jan' -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://$IP -t 10
```

* We get the password - `armando`.
