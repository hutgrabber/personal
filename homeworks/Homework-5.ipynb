        "\n",
        "- You are given a private key embedded in the code block below. 2 characters in the key were corrupted due to some error. Perform bruteforce attack on those 2 characters to generate a working private key which can be verified using the given verify() function below. \n",
        "- No modifications to the verify() functions are required. Just complete the bruteforce function.\n",
        "- The bruteforce function should \"return\" the correct key and not print it. \n",
        "- It may take only a 10 seconds or less for the attack to finish on Google Colab (which is visible on the bottom bar of the collab).\n",
        "- The format of the key should be similar to the given key.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Some important points to note about the missing bytes:\n",
        " - There are 2 characters positions (Index: 54,55) marked with ## which you need to bruteforce\n",
        " - The characters may repeat\n",
        " - Only lowercase alphabets and digits are needed (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890)\n",

        "##### Some helpful tips:\n",
        "- Itertools helps in generating strings for bruteforce.\n",
        "For instance, If you want to generate all permutations of characters 0 and 1 for length 2:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  permutations = itertools.product('01', repeat=2)\n",

        "1. It is really difficult/expensive/resource intensive to bruteforce private keys as they are.\n",
        "2. In the real world it is recommended to protect your keys with a strong passphrase. During the use of private key, the passphrase is required. Without which the key is not usable. This helps adding protection even in the unfortunate event of key being exposed.\n",
